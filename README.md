#BioinformHER Mini-Project: Comprehensive sequence analysis of the human TNF gene:

This is a repository for the BioinformHER Module 1 Mini Project, containing sequence files, analysis report, gene study insights and key findings.

##Objectif:
In this project, I conducted an in-depth sequence analysis of the Human Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) gene, employing a range of bioinformatics tools including BioEdit, GENSCAN, PROMO, and more in order explore the structural and functional characteristics of the Human TNF (tumor necrosis factor) gene.
